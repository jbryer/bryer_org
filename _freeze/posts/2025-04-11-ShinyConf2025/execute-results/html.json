As the name suggests, the premise is that much of the interaction with the package will be done through a Shiny application. However, all the functionality in the Shiny application is accessible through R commands. The core functionality of `ShinyQDA` allows researchers to highlight passages and code passages. The application also allows for scoring text documents using rubrics. Tools for conducting validity analysis using co-occurrence plots and code frequency is provided. In addition to traditional qualitative data analysis, `ShinyQDA` utilizes natural language processing to conduct sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text encoding (i.e. tokenization). `ShinyQDA` can be used locally by a single researcher or be deployed to a Shiny server so that multiple researchers can access the application to code and/or score documents.\n\nTo register for the (free) conference, go to [https://www.shinyconf.com](https://www.shinyconf.com)\n\nFor more information about the project, visit: [https://github.com/jbryer/ShinyQDA](https://github.com/jbryer/ShinyQDA)\n",
