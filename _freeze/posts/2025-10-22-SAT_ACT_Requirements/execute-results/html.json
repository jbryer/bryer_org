I wanted to see how the use of these high-stakes assessments have changed over the last decade. Turns out that I wrote a package years ago to work with the [Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds), [`ipeds`](https://github.com/jbryer/ipeds) and fortunately it still works! Currenlty, it is only on Github and can be installed using the `remotes` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nremotes::install_github('jbryer/ipeds')\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `surveys` data frame included in the package provides metadata for the different data files available from the IPEDS website. The `HD` data file provides directory information for each institution in the United States.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(surveys, package = 'ipeds')\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe are interested in the `admcon7` variable which has three levels indicating how each institution uses tests for admissions decisions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlevels <- c('1' = 'Required',\n\t\t\t'5' = 'Test Optional',\n\t\t\t'3'\t= 'Test Blind')\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe following block will download the directory information for 2014 through 2023 (the latest year currently available).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadmissions <- data.frame()\nyears <- 2014:2023\nfor(i in years) {\n\tadm <- getIPEDSSurvey('ADM', year = i)\n\tadm$admcon7 <- factor(adm$admcon7,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  levels = names(levels),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  labels = levels)\n\tadm$year <- i\n\tadmissions <- rbind(admissions, adm[,c('year', 'admcon7')])\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in getIPEDSSurvey(\"ADM\", year = i): This function has been deprecated\nand will be removed in a future version.
