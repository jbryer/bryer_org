Inter-rater reliability (IRR) is a critical component of establishing the reliability of measures when more than one rater is necessary. There are numerous IRR statistics available to researchers including percent rater agreement, Cohen’s Kappa, and several types of intraclass correlations (ICC). Several methodologists suggest using ICC over percent rater agreement (Hallgren, 2012; Koo & Li, 2016; McGraw & Wong, 1996; Shrout & Fleiss, 1979). However, the literature provides little guidance on the interpretation of ICC results. This article explores the relationship between ICC and percent rater agreement using simulations. Results suggest that ICC and percent rater agreement are highly correlated (R² > 0.9) for most designs used in education.
When raters are involved in scoring procedures, inter-rater reliability (IRR) measures are used to establish the reliability of instruments. Commonly used IRR measures include Percent Agreement, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Cohen’s Kappa (see Table 1). Several researchers recommend using ICC and Cohen’s Kappa over Percent Agreement (Hallgren, 2012; Koo & Li, 2016; McGraw & Wong, 1996; Shrout & Fleiss, 1979). Although it may appear that IRR measures are interchangeable, they reflect different information (AERA, NCME, & APA, 2014). For instance, Cohen’s Kappa and Percent Agreement reflect absolute agreement, while ICC (3, 1) reflect consistency between the raters (see Table XX). Inter-rater reliability is defined differently in terms of either consistency, agreement, or a combination of both. Yet, there are misconceptions and inconsistencies when it comes to proper application, interpretation and reporting of these measures (Kottner et al., 2011; Trevethan, 2017). In addition, researchers tend to recommend different thresholds for poor, moderate and good level of reliability (see Table 2). These inconsistencies, and the paucity of detailed reports of test methods, research designs and results perpetuate the misconceptions in the application and interpretation of IRR measures.
