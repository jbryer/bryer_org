description: "This package provides a framework for adding user authentication to Shiny applications. This is unique to other authentication frameworks such as ShinyManager and shinyauthr in that it provides tools for users to create their own accounts and reset passwords. This is particularly useful for Shiny applications used to collect data without a pre-existing user management system. User credentials are stored in any database that supports the DBI interface. Passwords are hashed using MD5 in the browser so that unencrypted passwords are never available to the Shiny server. For an extra layer of security, you can salt the password before storing it in the database."
