This workshop will introduce the basic concepts and procedures for predictive modeling in R including:

* How to evaluate the quality of predictive models using confusion matrices and ROC curves
* Classification and regression trees (CART methods)
* Ensemble methods (e.g. random forests, boosting, bagging)
* Discussion of issues and limitations of "black box" predictive modeling
