The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and predictive power of the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) on student success. DAACS is a diagnostic assessment tool designed to measure college studentsâ€™ reading, writing, mathematics, and self-regulated learning skills and provide them with feedback and resources to enhance their success. DAACS was embedded into new student orientation in Fall 2020 at a brick-and-mortar university. Of 2,389 enrolled students, 465 students completed the DAACS. Preliminary analyses indicate that the GPAs of students who completed DAACS were 0.35 points higher than students who did not complete DAACS. Additional results will be presented in the final paper presented at AERA 2022.
