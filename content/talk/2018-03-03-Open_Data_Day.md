I will be teaching a short Introduction to Shiny as part of the Open Data Day.

______
 
Open Data Day is a collection of local gatherings of open government advocates, developers, programmers, statisticians, and citizens who want to build things with and promote the use of open data through project hacking. The next Open Data Day is March 3, 2018. The event welcomes participants from all backgrounds, interests, and skill sets with a common enthusiasm for transparency. In addition to project hacking, participants can learn about some of the tools in the open data toolkit by joining in the training workshops.
