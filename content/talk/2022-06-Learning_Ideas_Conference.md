The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and predictive power of the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) on student success. DAACS is a no-stakes, open-source, diagnostic assessment tool designed to measure newly enrolled college studentsâ€™ reading, writing, mathematics, and self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, and provide them with feedback and resources to enhance their functioning and success. A randomized control trial was performed at two online colleges (n = 23,728) to measure the effects of DAACS on academic achievement and credit acquisition. Predictive power of DAACS on student success was also examined. 

This talk will describe: (1) what DAACS is, including its components along with validity and reliability evidence; (2) the effects on academic achievement and credit acquisition; and (3) predictive power on student success. The implications for higher education in context of traditional placement and remediation programs will be discussed. The importance of using DAACS as a suite of assessments and supports, and not as isolated components, will be emphasized.
