      <description>The purpose of this study was to identify the best fitting model to represent interrelationships between motivation, volition, and academic success for adult nursing students learning in nontraditional environments. Participants (N = 297) completed a survey that incorporated two measures: the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) and the Academic Volitional Strategies Inventory (AVSI) as well as demographic informa- tion. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used for data analysis.</description>
