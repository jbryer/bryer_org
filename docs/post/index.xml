      <description>During a recent class a student asked whether bootstrap confidence intervals were more robust than confidence intervals estimated using the standard error (i.e.Â \(SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\)). In order to answer this question I wrote a function to simulate taking a bunch of random samples from a population, calculate the confidence interval for that sample using the standard error approach (the t distribution is used by default, see the cv parameter.</description>

      <description>My son has been learning Python and wanted to know how many rounds does it take, on average, for someone to win the game of war. If you are not familar with the game, it is a two player game where each player gets half a deck of cards (26). For each round the player puts down their top card. Whoever has the higher card gets both cards. In the instance where there is a tie, each player puts down three more cards and flips the fourth card.</description>

 Introduction In the past several years academic conferences have begun to display poster presentations electronically. This provides an opportunity for authors to include interactivity into their posters. Shiny has become a popular and powerful framework for researchers to create interactive web applications. This poster and paper presents a framework for creating traditional two or three column posters using Shiny.</description>

      <description>I am working on a project where I need to upload PDFs generated from Rmarkdown to a SFTP server. The sftp R package is a nice wrapper to the RCurl package for handling SFTP access. But to my surprise, SFTP support is not included on Macs by default through the curl command. After some research I found the curl-openssl formula that includes SFTP support. However, since curl is a build-in program for Mac OS brew install will not install it into the PATH environment, therefore not being directly available.</description>

      <description>First, I want to give a plug to the RStats Strava Running Club. If you are into running, it is a great group that provides lots of support.
This post is inspired by this streetmaps tutorial over at ggplot2tutor.com on creating map artwork/posters. This post shows how to overlay running (which could be biking) routes.
The key for this to work is to get access to GPX (GPS Exchange format) files.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: You can test this approach using this Github Gist.
R Shiny Apps have become a popular way of creating web applications in R. There are many ways of running Shiny Apps including locally in RStudio, on Shinyapps.io or installing the server software on your own host. I have been increasingly using Shiny apps as a way to demonstrate and interact with R Packages, especially packages I write for teaching purposes.</description>

      <description>RStudio recently updated Shiny to allow for editable DataTables. Their implementations allows for editing cells direclty with in the DataTable view. This is fine for many advanced applications, however, for many applications more fine tuned control of what the user can edit is necessary. For example, you may want to only allow a subset of columns to be editable. Or you want to view a subset of columns in a spreadsheet view but allow other columns to be editable.</description>

      <description>Consider a pool table of length one. An 8-ball is thrown such that the likelihood of its stopping point is uniform across the entire table (i.e. the table is perfectly level). The location of the 8-ball is recorded, but not known to the observer. Subsequent balls are thrown one at a time and all that is reported is whether the ball stopped to the left or right of the 8-ball. Given only this information, what is the position of the 8-ball?</description>

      <description>Data caching is not new. It is often necessary to save intermediate data files when the process of loading and/or manipulating data takes a considerable amount of time. This problem is further complicated when working with dynamic data that changes regularly. In these situations it often sufficient to use data that is current with in some time frame (e.g. hourly, daily, weekly, monthly). One solution is to use a time-based job scheduler such as cron.</description>

      <description>One of the more interesting talks at this year&amp;rsquo;s useR! Conference was the heR Panel discussing the role of women in the R community. They estimate that fewer than 15% of package authors are women. One of the points brought up was that this is less than the percentage of women in statistics. Perhaps this is more related to the computer science aspect of R that that of statistics. By way of comparison, the United States Department of Labor estimates there are between 7.</description>

      <description>PSAboot is an R package to assist with bootstrapping propensity score methods. I gave a talk today at the useR! 2014 Conference. The slides can be downloaded from the PSAboot Github page or directly here. The package is described at jason.bryer.org/PSAboot and maintained on Github at github.com/jbryer/PSAboot/.
Also, version 1.1 of the package was just released to CRAN.</description>

      <description>The str function is perhaps the most useful function in R. It provides great information about the structure of some object. When I teach R, especially for those coming from SPSS, the str function for data frames provides the information they are use to seeing on the variable view tab. However, sometimes I want to display the information str returns in a better format (e.g. as an HTML or LaTeX table).</description>

      <description>Last week I published an R script to interface with Gitbook. I received some positive feedback and decided to include all the code in an R package. This also allowed me to make some nice additions including default support for MathJax. It is currently available on Github and can be installed using devtools:
devtools::install_github(&#39;jbryer/Rgitbook&#39;)  I have only tested this on Mac OS X, so please provide suggestions or issues on other systems.</description>

      <description>One of the more tedious parts of working with R is maintaining my R library. To make my R scripts reproducible and sharable, I will install packages if they are not available. For example, the top of my R scripts tend to look something like this:
if(!require(devtools) | !require(ggplot2) | !require(psych) | !require(lme4) | !require(benchmark)) { install.packages(c(&#39;devtools&#39;,&#39;ggplot2&#39;,&#39;psych&#39;,&#39;lme4&#39;,&#39;benchmark&#39;)) }  This has worked fine for some time, but I felt there was a better approach.</description>

      <description>I am happy to announce that version 1.0 of the PSAboot package has been released to CRAN. This package implements bootstrapping for propensity score analysis. This deviates from typical implementations such as boot in that it allows for separate sampling specifications for treatment and control units. For example, in the case where the ratio of treatment-to-control units is large, one can bootstrap only the control units while always using all available treatment units.</description>

To complicate things a bit, our fiscal year starts in July so that July, August, and September represent the first quarter, January, February, and March are actually the third quarter. But sometimes we do need need to report out based upon calendar years (i.e. where January is in the first quarter).</description>

Obviously there are lots of tools to interface with a database, but since we are all R users I thought it would be nice to be able interact without leaving R. Although this interface is fairly basic, the fact that we can type in a SQL statement and get the results as an R data frame provides all the advantages of having data in R.</description>

      <description>The xtable package is tremendously useful for generating LaTeX tables from data frames. It is also pretty easy to customize the output to handle some special cases of LaTeX formatting. The xtable.decimal function will create a LaTeX table where numeric columns will be vertically aligned on the decimal point. In addition to specifying the LaTeX alignment code it will also create appropriate column titles so that the column name spans the two resulting columns.</description>

require(ggplot2) grey50 &amp;lt;- data.frame( x = rep(1:10, 5), y = rep(1:5, each=10), c = unlist(lapply(seq(10,255,5), FUN=function(x) { rgb(x,x,x, max=255) })), t = unlist(lapply(seq(10,255,5), FUN=function(x) { ifelse(x &amp;gt; 255/2, &#39;black&#39;, &#39;white&#39;) })) ) ggplot(grey50, aes(x=x, y=y, fill=c, label=c, color=t)) + geom_tile() + geom_text(size=4) + scale_fill_identity() + scale_color_identity() + ylab(NULL) + xlab(NULL) + theme(axis.</description>

      <description>We all know that the odds of flipping an unbiased coin is 50% heads, 50% tails. But what happens if you do this a lot of times. Do you expect the same number of heads and tails? What if we took a cumulative sum where heads = +1 and tails = -1. What would that sum be? Here is a function that will do this n times and plot it.</description>

      <description>There are several graphics available for visualizing missing data including the VIM package. However, I wanted a plot specifically for looking at the nature of missingness across variables and a clustering variable of interest to support data preparation in multilevel propensity score models (see the multilevelPSA package). The following examples uses data from the Programme of International Student Assessment (PISA; see pisa package).
The required packages can be downloaded from github.</description>

      <description>I was inspired by Kay Cichini recent post on creating a a tcl/tk dialog box for users to enter variable values. I am going to have a use for this very soon so took some time to make it a bit more generic. What I wanted is a function that takes a vector (of variable names) of arbitrary length, create a dialog box for an input for each, and return the values in a list.</description>

      <description>Following up on John Mount&amp;rsquo;s post on remembering symbol parameters in ggplot2, I decided to give it a try and included symbols, line types, and colors (based upon Earl Glynn&amp;rsquo;s wonderful color chart). Code follows below.
require(ggplot2) require(grid) theme_update(panel.background=theme_blank(), panel.grid.major=theme_blank(), panel.border=theme_blank()) #Borrowed (i.e. stollen) from http://research.stowers-institute.org/efg/R/Color/Chart/ColorChart.R getColorHexAndDecimal &amp;lt;- function(color) { if(is.na(color)) { return(NA) } else { c &amp;lt;- col2rgb(color) return(sprintf(&amp;quot;#%02X%02X%02X %3d %3d %3d&amp;quot;, c[1],c[2],c[3], c[1], c[2], c[3])) } }  Symbols ggplot(data=data.</description>

      <description>Revisiting a fun puzzle I remember first encountering as an undergraduate. Nice example of creating a plot in R using ggplot2. I also plot the probability of someone in the room having the same birthday as you.
## See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem for an explanation of the problem require(ggplot2) require(reshape) theme_update(panel.background=theme_blank(), panel.grid.major=theme_blank(), panel.border=theme_blank()) birthday &amp;lt;- function(n) { 1 - exp( - n^2 / (2 * 365) ) } myBirthday &amp;lt;- function(n) { 1 - ( (365 - 1) / 365 ) ^ n } d = 200 df = data.</description>

      <description>Constructor Define S3 generic method for the print function. Test code        As someone who was a Java programmer for many years learning R&amp;rsquo;s object oriented programming framework has been frustrating to say the least. I like the simplicity of S3 but find it limiting when you wish to write methods that change the underlying data elements.</description>

      <description>I have been working on a new package makeR to help manage Sweave projects where you wish to create multiple versions of documents that are based on a single source. For example, I create lots of monthly and quarterly reports using Sweave and the only differences between versions are a few variables. I have used GNU make and Apache ANT but wanted a 100% R solution. I will have more to write about that project in a few weeks.</description>

      <description>I have become quite a big fan of graphics that combine the features ofÂ traditionalÂ figures (e.g. bar charts, histograms, etc.) with tables. That is, the combination of numerical results with a visual representation has been quite useful for exploring descriptive statistics. I have wrapped two of my favorites (build around ggplot2) and included them as part of my irutils R package (currently under development). Here is the code and results utilizing two item from the 2009 Programme of International StudentÂ AssessmentÂ (PISA).</description>

      <description>Here is a quick analysis of the relationship between SAT score and student retention. The data is from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and analyzed using R. This was a quick analysis and would be careful about making any strong conclusions. The source for running this analysis along with some additional graphics that are not included in this post. 
Here are the results of the regression analysis:    Estimate Std.</description>

      <description>Gapminder has posted an interestingÂ chart usingÂ world development indicators from the World Bank. I thought it would be a good exercise to recreate this chart using R and ggplot2. While playing with the data, not log transforming GDP provides some interesting, and perhaps different, interpretation. The R script and graphics are below.  Google Gadget Version   library(ggplot2) library(reshape) countries = read.csv(&#39;Data/WDI_GDF_Country.csv&#39;, strip.white=TRUE) worldData = read.csv(&#39;Data/WDI_GDF_Data.csv&#39;, strip.white=TRUE) worldData2 = worldData[which(worldData$Series.</description>
