  <title>Predictive Modeling with Missing Data</title>
  <dc:creator>Jason Bryer</dc:creator>

<p>Most predictive modeling strategies require there to be no missing data for model estimation. When there is missing data, there are generally two strategies for working with missing data: 1.) exclude the variables (columns) or observations (rows) where there is missing data; or 2.) impute the missing data. However, data is often missing in systematic ways. Excluding data from training is ignoring potentially predictive information and for many imputation procedures the missing completely at random (MCAR) assumption is violated. The medley package implements a solution to modeling when there are systematic patterns of missingness. A working example of predicting student retention from a larger study of the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) will be explored. In this study, demographic data was collected at enrollment from all students and then students completed diagnostic assessments in self-regulated learning (SRL), writing, mathematics, and reading during their first few weeks of the semester. Although all students were expected to complete DAACS, there were no consequence and therefore a large percentage of student completed none or only some of the assessments. The resulting dataset has three predominate response patterns: 1.) students who completed all four assessments, 2.) students who completed only the SRL assessment, and 3). students who did not complete any of the assessments. The goal of the medley algorithm is to take advantage of missing data patterns. For this example, the medley algorithm trained three predictive models: 1.) demographics plus all four assessments, 2.) demographics plus SRL assessment, and 3.) demographics only. For both training and prediction, the model used for each student is based upon what data is available. That is, if a student only completed SRL, model 2 would be used. The medley algorithm can be used with most statistical models. For this study, both logistic regression and random forest are used. The accuracy of the medley algorithm was 3.5% better than using only the complete data and 3.1% better than using a dataset where missing data was imputed using the mice package. The medley package provides an approach for predictive modeling using the same training and prediction framework R users are accustomed to using. There are numerous parameters that can be modified including what underlying statistical models are used for training. Additional diagnostic functions are available to explore missing data patterns.</p>

  <title>clav: R package and Shiny application for cluster analysis validation</title>
  <dc:creator>Jason Bryer</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Cluster analysis is a statistical procedure for grouping observations using an observation-centered approach as compared to variable-centric approaches (e.g.&nbsp;PCA, factor analysis). Whether a preprocessing step for predictive modeling or the primary analysis, validation is critical for determining generalizability across datasets. Theodoridis and Koutroumbas (2008) identified three broad types of validation for cluster analysis: 1) Internal cluster validation, 2) Relative cluster validation, and 3) External cluster validation. Strategies for steps 1 and 2 are well established, however cluster analysis is typically an unsupervised learning method where there is no observed outcome. Ullman et al (2021) proposed an approach to validating a cluster solution by visually inspecting the cluster solutions across a training and validation dataset. This talk introduces the clav R package that implements and expands this approach by generating multiple random samples (using either a simple random split or bootstrap samples). Visualizations of both the cluster profiles as well as distributions of the cluster means are provided along with a Shiny application to assist the researcher.</p>

<p>A student will also be presenting <em>AI-Generated Text Detection in the Context of Domain- and Prompt-Specific Essays</em></p>
<p>The widespread adoption of Large Language Models has made distinguishing between human- and AI-generated essays more challenging. This study explores AI detection methods for domain- and prompt-specific essays within the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) framework, applying both random forest and fine-tuned ModernBERT classifiers. Our approach incorporates pre-chatGPT essays, likely human-generated, alongside synthetic datasets of essays generated and modified by AI. The random forest classifier was trained with open-source embeddings such as miniLM, RoBERTa, and a low-cost OpenAI model, using a one-versus-one strategy. The ModernBERT method employed a novel two-level fine-tuning strategy, incorporating essay-level and sentence-pair classifications that combines global text features with detailed sentence transitions through coherence scoring and style consistency detection. Together, these methods effectively identify whether essays have been altered by AI. Our approach provides a cost-effective solution for specific domains and serves as a robust alternative to generic AI detection tools, all while enabling local execution on consumer-grade hardware.</p>

  <title>ShinyQDA: R Package and Shiny Application for the Analysis of Qualitative Data</title>
  <dc:creator>Jason Bryer</dc:creator>
  <link>https://bryer.org/posts/2025-04-11-ShinyConf2025.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The <code>ShinyQDA</code> R package is designed to assist researchers with the analysis of qualitative data. As the name suggests, the premise is that much of the interaction with the package will be done through a Shiny application. However, all the functionality in the Shiny application is accessible through R commands. The core functionality of <code>ShinyQDA</code> allows researchers to highlight passages and code passages. The application also allows for scoring text documents using rubrics. Tools for conducting validity analysis using co-occurrence plots and code frequency is provided. In addition to traditional qualitative data analysis, <code>ShinyQDA</code> utilizes natural language processing to conduct sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text encoding (i.e.&nbsp;tokenization). <code>ShinyQDA</code> can be used locally by a single researcher or be deployed to a Shiny server so that multiple researchers can access the application to code and/or score documents.</p>

  <title>login: User Authentication for Shiny Applications</title>
  <dc:creator>Jason Bryer</dc:creator>
  <link>https://bryer.org/posts/2024-04-17-ShinyConf2024.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The <code>login</code> package provides a framework for adding user authentication to Shiny applications. This is unique to other authentication frameworks such as ShinyManager and shinyauthr in that it provides tools for users to create their own accounts and reset passwords. This is particularly useful for Shiny applications used to collect data without a pre-existing user management system. User credentials are stored in any database that supports the DBI interface. Passwords are hashed using MD5 in the browser so that unencrypted passwords are never available to the Shiny server. For an extra layer of security, you can salt the password before storing it in the database. Cookie support is provided so that users do not have to re-enter their credentials when revisiting the application and user <code>login</code> and logout actives are logged to the database. Examples of how this package is used for collecting data from students will be presented.</p>

  <title>Estimating Causality from Observational Data</title>
  <dc:creator>Jason Bryer</dc:creator>

<p>The use of propensity score methods (Rosenbaum &amp; Rubin, 1983) for estimating causal effects in observational studies or certain kinds of quasi-experiments has been increasing in the social sciences (Thoemmes &amp; Kim, 2011) and in medical research (Austin, 2008) in the last decade. Propensity score analysis (PSA) attempts to adjust selection bias that occurs due to the lack of randomization. Analysis is typically conducted in three phases where in phase I, the probability of placement in the treatment is estimated to identify matched pairs or clusters so that in phase II, comparisons on the dependent variable can be made between matched pairs or within clusters, and phase III, robustness to unobserved covariates is estimated. R (R Core Team, 2023) is ideal for conducting PSA given its wide availability of the most current statistical methods vis-à-vis add-on packages as well as its superior graphics capabilities.</p>
<p>This talk will provide participants with a theoretical overview of propensity score methods as well as illustrations and discussion of PSA applications. Methods used in phase I of PSA (i.e.&nbsp;models or methods for estimating propensity scores) include logistic regression, classification trees, and matching. Discussions on appropriate comparisons and estimations of effect size and confidence intervals in phase II will also be covered. The use of graphics for diagnosing covariate balance as well as summarizing overall results will be emphasized.</p>
