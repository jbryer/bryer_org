 * [`difftable.plot`](difftable.plot.html) This function produces a ggplot2 figure contianing the mean differences for
 each level two, or cluster.

 * [`geom_rug_alt`](geom_rug_alt.html) Alternate Marginal Rug Plot Geom for ggplot2

 * [`getPropensityScores`](getPropensityScores.html) Returns a data frame with two columns corresponding to the level 2 variable
 and the fitted value from the logistic regression.

 * [`getStrata`](getStrata.html) Returns a data frame with two columns corresponding to the level 2 variable
 and the leaves from the conditional inference trees.

 * [`is.mlpsa`](is.mlpsa.html) Returns true if the object is of type `mlpsa`

 * [`loess.plot`](loess.plot.html) Loess plot with density distributions for propensity scores and outcomes on
 top and right, respectively.

 * [`mlpsa.difference.plot`](mlpsa.difference.plot.html) Creates a graphic summarizing the differences between treatment and comparison
 groups within and across level two clusters.

 * [`mlpsa.distribution.plot`](mlpsa.distribution.plot.html) Plots distribution for either the treatment or comparison group.
