I have been working on a presentation regarding college readiness and the use of SAT/ACT for college admissions as part of the [Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills](https://daacs.net). I wanted to see how the use of these high-stakes assessments have changed over the last decade. Turns out that I wrote a package years ago to work with the [Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds), [`ipeds`](https://github.com/jbryer/ipeds) and fortunately it still works! Currenlty, it is only on Github and can be installed using the `remotes` package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github('jbryer/ipeds')
```

The `surveys` data frame included in the package provides metadata for the different data files available from the IPEDS website. The `HD` data file provides directory information for each institution in the United States.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
data(surveys, package = 'ipeds')
```

We are interested in the `admcon7` variable which has three levels indicating how each institution uses tests for admissions decisions.

```{r}
levels <- c('1' = 'Required',
			'5' = 'Test Optional',
			'3'	= 'Test Blind')
```

The following block will download the directory information for 2014 through 2023 (the latest year currently available).

```{r, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
admissions <- data.frame()
years <- 2014:2023
for(i in years) {
	adm <- getIPEDSSurvey('ADM', year = i)
	adm$admcon7 <- factor(adm$admcon7,
						  levels = names(levels),
						  labels = levels)
	adm$year <- i
	admissions <- rbind(admissions, adm[,c('year', 'admcon7')])
}
```

The figure below shows a pretty striking change in how institutions have used high stakes assessments like the SAT and ACT for admissions decisions around 2020 (not sure what happened that year ðŸ˜‰).

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
tab <- table(admissions$year, admissions$admcon7) |>
	prop.table(1) |>
	reshape2::melt() |>
	dplyr::rename(Year = Var1, Test_Use = Var2)

p <- ggplot(tab, aes(x = Year, y = value, group = Test_Use, color = Test_Use)) +
	geom_path(linewidth = 1.5) +
	geom_point(shape = 16, size = 4, color = 'white') +
	geom_point(shape = 1, size = 4) +
	scale_color_manual('Test usage: ', 
					   values = c('Required' = '#7209B7', 
					   		      'Test Optional' = '#84DB8F', 
					   		      'Test Blind' = '#E2BD6B')) +
	scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
	scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(years, max(years) + 1),
					   labels = c(years, max(years) + 1),
					   limits = c(min(years), max(years) + 1)) +
	theme_minimal() +
	# xlim(c(2014, 2024)) +
	theme(legend.position = 'bottom') +
	ggtitle('Use of high stakes assessments (SAT/ACT) for college admissions') +
	ylab('Percentage of Institutions')

directlabels::direct.label(p, "last.qp")
```
