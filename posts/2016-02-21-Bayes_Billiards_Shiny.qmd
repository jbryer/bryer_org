Consider a pool table of length one. An 8-ball is thrown such that the likelihood of its stopping point is uniform across the entire table (i.e. the table is perfectly level). The location of the 8-ball is recorded, but not known to the observer. Subsequent balls are thrown one at a time and all that is reported is whether the ball stopped to the left or right of the 8-ball. Given only this information, what is the position of the 8-ball? How does the estimate change as more balls are thrown and recorded?

You can run the app from RStudio's [shinyapps.io](https://jbryer.shinyapps.io/BayesBilliards/) service at [jbryer.shinyapps.io/BayesBilliards](https://jbryer.shinyapps.io/BayesBilliards).

The Shiny App is included in the [`DATA606`](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606) package on Github and can be run, once installed, using the `DATA606::shiny_demo('BayesBilliards')` function.

Or, run the app directly from Github using the `shiny::runGitHub('DATA606', 'jbryer', subdir='inst/shiny/BayesBilliards')` function.
