`PSAboot` is an R package to assist with bootstrapping propensity score methods. I gave a talk today at the [useR! 2014 Conference](http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu). The slides can be [downloaded from the PSAboot Github page](https://github.com/jbryer/PSAboot) or directly [here](https://github.com/jbryer/PSAboot/blob/master/Slides/Slides.pdf?raw=true). The package is described at [jason.bryer.org/PSAboot](http://jason.bryer.org/PSAboot) and maintained on Github at [github.com/jbryer/PSAboot/](https://github.com/jbryer/PSAboot/).

Also, version 1.1 of the package was just released to [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PSAboot/).
