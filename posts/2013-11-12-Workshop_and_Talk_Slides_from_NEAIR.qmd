I am about to head home from my fifth time attending the [North East Association for Institutional Research (NEAIR)](http://www.neair.org/?), this year in Newport, RI, which was just fantastic. Really great people, interesting talks, and good food. I again taught an *Introduction to R and LaTeX for Institutional Research* pre-conference workshop and also gave a talk on Propensity Score Analysis for Institutional Research which was an brief version of a workshop I taught at the 2013 useR! Conference in Spain. Here are links to my slides and materials:

* *Introduction to R and LaTeX for Institutional Research*: [Slides](https://github.com/jbryer/IntroRandLaTeXforIR/blob/master/Slides/IntroRforIR-Presentation.pdf?raw=true), [Github Repository](https://github.com/jbryer/IntroRandLaTeXforIR)
Abstract: This workshop will provide an overview as well as hands-on exercises for using R and LaTeX to
perform data analysis and report generation. Participants will learn to perform basic statistical
analyses in R and to generate reports with LaTeX in spreadsheet, presentation, and document
formats.

* *Introduction to Propensity Score Analysis for Institutional Researchers* [Slides](https://github.com/jbryer/IntroPSAwithR/blob/master/NEAIR2013%20Slides/Slides.pdf?raw=true), [Github Repository](https://github.com/jbryer/IntroPSAwithR)
Abstract: This workshop will provide an overview as well as hands-on exercises for using R and LaTeX to

You find many more resources at the Github repositories including R scripts and demos.

I would also like to thank NEAIR as I was recipient of their Ambassador Grant which help defray some of the cost for me to attend this year's useR! Conference in Spain.
